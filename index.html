        <h3>Mawphlang Sacred Forest</h3>
        <p>The Mawphlang Sacred Forest in the state of Meghalaya is said to be protected by a deity named Labasa. Locals say that if an object belonging to the forest, even a leaf or a tiny pebble, is removed, Labasa tends to get upset. It is believed that once, soldiers from the Indian Army took a log from the forest. But when they loaded their truck, the vehicle just wouldn’t start, so they had to put the log back in the forest. Mawphlang Sacred Forest is, therefore, enchanting not just for its beauty but also for its supernatural quality.</p>

        <h3>Barsey Rhododendron Sanctuary</h3>
        <p>Barsey Rhododendron Sanctuary is a forest in Sikkim, a small state in the north-east region of India. When the flowers are in full bloom, between late March and May, the sleepy forest suddenly becomes shrouded in stunning colours. The forest trail is ideal for short hikes as it can easily be completed under two hours and is not very challenging. Barsey is also the starting point for the popular Gorkhey-Phalut trek through the Singalila National Park in Darjeeling.</p>

        <h3>Chokramudi Peak</h3>
        <p>Chokramudi is a peak located in the Western Ghats mountain range in the beautiful hill-station of Munnar in Kerala. While the view from Chokramudi Peak is breathtaking, the forest trail that takes you to the summit makes for an equally amazing experience. Along the way is a dense shola, which is a patch of stunted tropical forest found in the hills of South India. Watch out for rain as the rocky path tends to get slippery when it is wet.</p>

         <h3>AndharBan</h3>
         <p>Andharban, which means dark forest, is another woodland worth visiting in the great Western Ghats. Monsoon season is the best time to enjoy this jungle trek near the city of Pune when the lush green forest has just been replenished by heavy rain. This unusual trail requires you to climb downhill for about three to four hours until you reach the heart of Andharban. Streams and cascading waterfalls dotting the thick forest all add to its charm.</p>

            <h3>Deoria Tal, Uttarakhand</h3>
            <p>Deoria Tal is a lake situated at an altitude of about 8,000 feet and is believed by the Hindus to be the bathing place of the gods. To reach the lake, you have to trek across a thick, wooded forest. It’s a good idea to camp for the night in the jungle for a more wholesome experience. This part of the forest trail is lined with rhododendron trees, which bloom during the spring. For bird watchers, especially, the hike up to Deoria Tal is full of excitement and surprises.</p>
